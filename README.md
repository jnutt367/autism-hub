# Autism Hub
 
# Here are the details of the Autism Hub:
## Project that Patricia and I are creating from start to finish together.
### First I made an empathy map and will be conducting several interviews with potential users. I am putting the original sketch of the empathy map and it's developing versions inside of the Trello board on the make an empathy map card for the poject.

## The above is a Trello project management board that also tracks the progress from backlog to publication and deployment. 
## I believe this will be a MERN application but the jury is still out. We wil utilize the best solution that fits our needs when further investigated.
